# Automatic Periodic Screen Shot Utility
 Simple Delphi utility to automatically create and save periodic screen shots

Automatically captures when minimized. 

This is quick and dirty and needs some refactoring (like naming the components!) Doesn't persist settings, and doesn't use `Screen.Monitors` to allow you to pick which desktop/monitor to capture, so only captures the main/default monitor right now.
